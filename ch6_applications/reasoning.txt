Here we want to discuss some simulations of synamical stochasti systems
with the idea of trying to find interesting examples whose applications
can be successfully combined with the signature.

The Neural/B oscilattors are interesting since we can see the noise
    causing a switching of attractors;
    can I use the signature maybe to PREDICT when for a system it will
        be the case? Or does the singature say something?

The OU process is interesting because it is governed by a single parameter
    alpha and we have a likelihood estimator for alpha,
    so maybe we can do some regression and compare performances
    with signature methods.

Finally the stochastic volatility models are opportunities for forther
    more realistic applications.
