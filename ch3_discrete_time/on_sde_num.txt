Euler:
basically like the ODE case, but at each step we add the Gaussian noise
Now we have probabilistic paths. Therefore different at each run.

STRONG CONVERGENCE
A form of computing error is wrt expected pathwise error, where we fix a
time and compute:
E|X_true - X_approximated|
if this quantity is bounded by C h^p, i.e. we have:

E|X_true - X_approx| <= C h^p

then we have order p.
Euler has now (strong) order 1/2 (cf with ODE case where it has order 1).
Since it does not perform so well, further numerical methods are justified.


WEAK CONVERGENCE
In this case we are NOT interested in the specific value of X_T,
i.e. the true solution at time T, but rather in its probabilistic distribution.
We care about the probability distribution of X_T, in particular
about estimating its moments.

Therefore we have weak convergence of order p iff:
| E(g(X_T)) - E(g(X_TRUE))| <= C h^p
where g is a class of functions which includes polynomials
(polynomials are needed to estimate the momentum).

SUMMING UP:
If we want the VALUE X_T, go for strong convergence.
If we want the DISTRUBUTION of some functional of interest E[g(X_T)]
    go for the weak convergence.
Euler converges typically 1 for weak, 0.5 for strong.
According to the case, one numerical schemre might me more appropriate
    than another.


Do not forget about stability, the property of controlling the error propagation
    at every step thanks mainly to Lipschitzianity.
