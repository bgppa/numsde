Euler:
basically like the ODE case, but at each step we add the Gaussian noise
Now we have probabilistic paths. Therefore different at each run.

STRONG CONVERGENCE
A form of computing error is wrt expected pathwise error, where we fix a
time and compute:
E|X_true - X_approximated|
if this quantity is bounded by C h^p, i.e. we have:

E|X_true - X_approx| <= C h^p

then we have order p.
Euler has now (strong) order 1/2 (cf with ODE case where it has order 1).
Since it does not perform so well, further numerical methods are justified.
