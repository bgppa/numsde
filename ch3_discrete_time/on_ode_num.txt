Basically y_n+1 = y_n + h * a(t+n, y_n)
is the standard Euler.
The asymptotic rate of final error of x_true - y_approx at time T
gives the global error bound; of order 1 with Euler and related to
how much we expand Taylor in derivative.

Further Taylor expansions are not to nice since involves knowing derivatives
of a; but you can approximate them and obtain RK method/similars.

If y_n+1 depends not only on y_n, but also on y_n-1, etc...,
you have a MULTISTEP method. You can mix stuff.


Anyway the Euler method is very nice since can be peacefully extended to the
SDE case.
